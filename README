Requirements:
- Play Framework 2.2.1
- Scala 2.10.2
- Java 1.7.0_40
  (maybe it's compatibile with other versions... these are just what I've been working with)
- Some SQL database.
  Currently it's configured for PostgreSQL 9.3.1 but could be easily switched to something
  else by just chaning build.sbt and conf/application.conf
- A single table in that database. See scripts/create_access_tokens.sql


To run:
play run

To develop:
play eclipse


I've also removed my credentials from conf/twitter4j.properties. Get your own!

There might be some extra unused files and stuff auto-generated by Play left lying around
